# MVC
Day 1: https://github.com/BoiseCodeWorks/late-Fall21-swapi
Day 2: 






Controller handles the TRY CATCH
Service handles the async await

async: may have to wait on one of these lines
post: create method; takes 2 arguments, 1st url, 2nd object

swapi.dev

*log the RES!*

ALWAYS register the listener before you get the data

axios formats the API's for us



math.random, index 0-3, splice them to display


callback: passing a function as an argument



C- create: .post
R- read: .get
U- update: .put
D- destroy: .delete



Keep checked box:
${this.checked}

get checked(){
  if(!this.id){
    return `div`
  }
  return`
  
  ${this.completed ? 'checked' : ''}`
}

Process:
link in the api(s)
create main classes of controller and service, link in app state
service class: pull in api information, run the res
Controller: async the api to run on console.log
Controller: draw method; invoke w/ proxystate in class
