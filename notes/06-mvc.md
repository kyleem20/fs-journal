Service- makes rules
Controller- handles user input, draws to the page
Model- blueprint for 1 element, where the data is defined
AppState- holds the data

constructor: what you want to happen when the page loads

this: the instance that has been created and looked at
observer patters: proxystate.on when something changes, "run the draw function"

getters are Capitalized

Inheritance is taking a class and adding more (derives a base class and adds to it)

Default changes where the exported item doesn't have curly brackets and renames the 1 exported item

bcw-create -> creates templates
npm i
npm run sass

Class is the definition, instance is the one being looked at
every Class needs a capitalized at the beginning, the instance needs an initial lowercase letter

Methods exist on a class. Functions exists to a class.
Method example: find


look into checked attribute to appear on reload (ternary)
