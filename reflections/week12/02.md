# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

Finished server on Monday, so making progress on front end today. It's a difficult switch though. It's taking a minute to transition to front end after doing C#.

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
