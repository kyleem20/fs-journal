# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

I am enjoying my struggles. I did get stuck for too long on a couple of items, but I knew I could figure it out. It just took me a while. What point do we say I've been working on this one item for too long and I can't fix it, can I get help? I think I need guidance on how long it long enough and too long to try to solve a problem with little to no progress?

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
