## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip is all the buttons don't have to be different colors. I love color and would make them all different, but knowing visualy it looks better without all the color will help when I get overwhelmed with how many colors I have on the page.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

 I think these are good resources based on different criteria, but mostly that I can easily navigate these websites and I like they way they are laid out.

Examples:  https://boisecodeworks.com/ ; https://jessakae.com/ ; https://fonts.google.com/

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design shows how much a company cares about their user interface. I've gone to websites where the design it either super busy or I don't understand how to locate things on their site that I have left. 
The design shows your care about your customers/visitors. You want them to be there and you took the time to make it presentable and easily interacable with them.
