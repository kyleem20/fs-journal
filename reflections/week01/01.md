## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

  It's a great way to share code with other developers and keep track of changes other developers have made on projects. It makes it much easier for multiple people to edit code and maintain a working code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

  It allows different developers to work on the same project without having to worry about another developer editing the code they have been working on or imputing code that breaks.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is the command used and developed by other developers. GitHub was developed as a storage place for people to share their projects and easily collaborate on projects together.
