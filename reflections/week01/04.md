## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Make a low-budget outline of a website to get ideas of what the client is looking for in their website. Give you an idea of what you need to create.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity: pen-and-paper; low detail; just to get the idea of the layout.
Mid-fidelity: website layout; creates an actual visual of the represented idea of the site.
High-fidelity: close to the final site; contains images and desired color scheme; gives the closer look of the site.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

They are worth the time. It's hard to change a website if the only thing the client has seen is the "end" product. They likely have a different vision for the website than what was created.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Initial outlines don't have to have all the detail. They can be extremely helpful on brainstorming what the desired layout it before putting in the work to start making in and finding out the client wants something completely different.
