# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
I think this week went really well starting off. I generally understand the code and layouts we've been using. I'm struggling with 2 items.
1. Inserting icons. What I did for the checkpoint was download the image and add it as a png file. I know there is a way that I don't have to do that, but I'm uncertain of what it is exactly.
2. I think I use way too many rows and columns. I think a discussion on when you really need them and when you can make the format work without it would be helpful. I have so many rows and columns that it almost becomes overwhelming to work on my code.
