## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

The pseudo-class is the "example:hover" set up. From the css diner, some useful examples that I think will be used frequently are- :root, :required; :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child .

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

specificity is how exact you get to calling a speific line for styling. If I want an item to be exactly what I choose it to be, rather than the overall set color, I can specify the css code so that the value is higher than it is without more specificity to it. Ex: body{color: green;} (specificity is 1) but .left {color: yellow;} (specificity is 10) so yellow would be the displayed color on whatever is in the class="left" section.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The specificity rules could be ultimately ignored in the style.css code if !important is used in the .html file. It can also cause frustration between developers when someone else has to change parameters and !important has been used a lot so it no longer becomes an easy change.
