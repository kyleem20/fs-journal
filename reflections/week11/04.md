## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

    I've really enjoyed this course. It was a lot to understand the process that we get introduced to things, but after the first couple of weeks it started to really feel like I was learning and keeping up. It's a lot really fast, but it works out.
    I'm concerned that I might not completely know how to do all the things for the backend. I've learned a lot and I understand most of it when I can reference examples, but it's hard to remember where to find examples. 
    I'm planning on managing my time by not getting hung up on problems for too long. If I spend more than 30 minutes on a problem with no progress, I want to move to a new problem to solve and come back to the original. It's possible I might come across the issue I was having while working through other parts. I also plan on keeping track of the bigger problems I have that I cannot solve with my references.
    I've really enjoyed the environment we've been taught in. Staff and classmates have been really friendly and make coming to class fun. I feel accomplished in what I've learned that I can create full stack applications. Progress from week 1 is insane.
