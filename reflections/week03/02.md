## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To limit the external access to code so that users cannot manipulate the data 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

"Internal properties and methods tend to change more frequently than public properties and methods. For many, underscore prefixed methods, e.g., myComponent._handleClick refer to methods that they do not intend users of the API to call directly. Instead, theyâ€™re used only internally, and as such, if their implementations change, or if theyâ€™re entirely deleted, those developers would not consider that to be a breaking change."

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

create a class that is exported to make it public. Private is kept internally. This is done so that users cannot manipulate the data.
