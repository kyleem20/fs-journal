## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

    Value: if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values (bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long,sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort,); system creates a separate copy of a variable in another method. If value got changed in the one method, it wouldnâ€™t affect the variable in another method.
    Reference: stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. (String, Arrays, Class, Delegate)
    Pointer: do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Also, boxing and unboxing do not support pointers. However, you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

    bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort
    There are a lot more value types than we had in Javascript

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    
    Reference type holds a location of the information; Value type holds the data related to the variable as is
