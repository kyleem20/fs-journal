## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

    rows are complete objects (e.g., book) and columns are specific properties (e.g., title, author, etc.).

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL primary key, name TEXT NOT NULL, age INT NOT NULL, description TEXT NOT NULL );

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Delete: this will delete a specific object from the table
Drop: this will delete the whole table
