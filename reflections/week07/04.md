## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

    We thought about how this project would look in a developer portfolio and tried to make sure it looked nice on the visual part of it.

2. What went well this week?

    We were able to learn a lot about building the website that we maybe were't totally clear on.

3. What would you do differently?

    Have everyone work together to understand what we were working on with the backend to make it a better connection with the front end.
