## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time management with setting time to do specific things.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Two-minute rule: if I can respond to something immediately in under 2 minutes, I should do it it. If not, I need to make a note in my schedule to accomplish it.
I want to use the focus booster to keep track of tasks I accomplish. Mostly so that I can see what I accomplish each day.
Knowing when my "golden hours" are will help me find the best way to utilize that time to accomplish high priority tasks.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

At my old job, I had a pattern I would follow each day when I would get in. Learning how to time box my time would have helped a lot with when I was training the next person so that they can understand how long it generally took me to accomplish each task.
