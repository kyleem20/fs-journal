## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one to one: one to many: many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

You don't have to update the item that is linked, it is automatically upated. Embedding forces manual updates of changes/broken relationships.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

One challenge is how many connections/categories can be created for a relationship item. If the ratio difference is large, one way embedding may work better. If it's close to the same number, two way embedding may work better.
