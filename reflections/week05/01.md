## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

Data can be passed into any request using a query string. Once passed, the data can be captured in node from the request object. This data can be used for anything you like, from a filter, to adding additional context to a request.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

?key=value&othervalue
?: query
key: key search word category
= : must include
&: either of these

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

When parsing through a lot of information
