## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

The range in which something can be used/applied.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Brings a variable/function to the top of the range it was called in variables and function declarations 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Var: for when you need to change a variable later or want to re-define it.
Let; when you might need to update a variable but not redefine it.
Const; when you don't want to change a variable but want to updated the properties.

--Notes:
 var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. can be redeclared;
 let is preferred for variable declaration now, block scoped, updated but not redeclared;
 const are block scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared, object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated;
