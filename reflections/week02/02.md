## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function Declaration: ; Function Expression: ; Arrow Function Expression;

Notes:
Function Declaration: defines a named function. To create a function declaration you use the function keyword followed by the name of the function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined
Function Expression: Function Expressions defines a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that has no name. Function Expressions are not hoisted, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined
Arrow Function Expression: shorter syntax for writing function expressions. Arrow functions do not create their own this value.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?



3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
