## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

I think this is referring to using console.log() and return? This can be helpful when checking if your code is doing what you want it to or to find where the error can be in the code if it;s not behaving properly.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Elements Tab: you can edit the code directly and see in real time how it will effect the result of the page/output.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use debugger or the Network tab. These will help breakdown your code line by line to determine if it's bringing in the functions/results you're looking for.
